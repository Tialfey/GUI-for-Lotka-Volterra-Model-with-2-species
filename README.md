# GUI-for-Lotka-Volterra-Model-with-2-species
This is a basic GUI that receives inputs and feeds them into the algorithm which generates a population vs time graph
to get proper results, please have an extended time range t>5000
population numbers in the range of thousands
death and birth rate <0.01,
and % of prey caught per predator<0.001,
but feel free to try with different numbers,
heres an example,
t=10000,
death and birth rate=0.005,
% prey caught per predator=0.00005,
% of predator born per prey caught=1,
predators initial=2000,
prey initial=5000.
